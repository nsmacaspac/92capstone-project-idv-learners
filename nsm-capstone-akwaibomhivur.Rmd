## Introduction


HIV remains a major issue under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 (World Health Organization 2023). HIV infection still has no cure, but current antiretroviral therapy enables patients to suppress the viral load and enables their immune system to functionally recover (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 1; World Health Organization n.d.). However, treatment failure due to patient noncompliance, drug reaction, and viral drug resistance occurs (Kitchen et al. 2001, 466). 

In resource-rich settings, detecting treatment failure through regular viral load monitoring and genotypic drug resistance testing allows for a timely change in therapy (Revell et al. 2010, 605). Periodic viral genotyping may not be as feasible though in resource-limited settings, such as in African countries where two-thirds of patients with HIV infection are from (World Health Organization 2023). In such cases, examining clinical outcomes for cost-effective markers of treatment failure is of value (Kitchen et al. 2001, 466).

This project develops a machine-learning model that classifies and predicts antiretroviral therapy reaction and failure from a database of clinical outcomes of patients who received treatment for HIV infection in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria (Ekpenyong et al. 2021b, Appendix). In the succeeding sections, we examine the dataset, predictors, and outcome, then successively train and test possible classification models.

This undertaking is part of the capstone in the [Professional Certificate Program in Data Science of Harvard Online](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/data-science-professional-certificate). The corresponding R Markdown and R files are in the [GitHub of nsmacaspac](https://github.com/nsmacaspac/92capstone-project-idv-learners).


## Unique Records of the Akwa Ibom HIV Database


In a previous study on patient response to antiretroviral therapy, Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson (2019, 3) used a database of patients who received treatment for HIV infection from thirteen health centers in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria, between 2015 and 2018. Two years later, they published the processed dataset (Ekpenyong et al. 2021b, Appendix) with minor oversight in the accompanying article, which were easily reconciled through the 2019 study and were appropriately referenced throughout this project. The processed dataset is composed of an Individual Treatment Change Episodes table with a column for each antiretroviral drug administered and a concatenated Unique Records table with the drugs combined into a column for each antiretroviral therapy of three drugs administered. For the purpose of this project, we utilize only the Unique Records table.

The Unique Records table was imported with the corresponding read_xlsx function in the language R. The dataset is composed of 1,056 patient records, each with fifteen columns: patient identification, sex, baseline CD4 count, follow-up CD4 count, baseline RNA load, follow-up RNA load, baseline weight, follow-up weight, drug combination, patient response, and drug reaction classifications 1 to 5 (fig. 1).

```{r}
options(timeout = 120) # timeout in seconds for some Internet operations
if(!file.exists("mmc1.xlsx")) download.file("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8142042/bin/mmc1.xlsx", "mmc1.xlsx")

if(!require(readxl)) install.packages("readxl", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org") # require() checks if the package exists
library(readxl)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dataset <- as.data.frame(read_xlsx("mmc1.xlsx", range = "N27:AB1083")) # range reads 
 # the Unique Records table, which is the combined version of 
 # the Individual Treatment Change Episodes table
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "First rows of the Unique Records table of the Akwa Ibom HIV Database."}
include_graphics("fig1.png")
```

The immunological marker CD4 count is given in cells per cubic millimeter (Ekpenyong et al. 2021a, 8). The viral RNA load is expressed in times 10^2^ copies (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 10). The weight ranges from 4.7 to 125 kg on account of the presence of pediatric patients (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 2). The three-drug combinations of antiretroviral therapy are a complementary mix of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), and zidovudine (AZT), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz (EFV) and nivarapine (NVP) given in the first 6 months of treatment (Ekpenyong et al. 2021a, 8).

Patient response and drug reaction were quantified and classified in the 2019 study using expert domain knowledge and the advanced method of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 4, 7). The drug reaction classification uses a binary system to indicate very high interaction (C1), high interaction (C2), low interaction (C3), very low interaction (C4), and no interaction (C5; Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 11). A low response rate signifies high to very high drug interactions and treatment failure, whereas a high response rate denotes low to no drug interactions (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 10, 13).


### _Tidy Dataset_


The dataset was rendered into tidy format to prepare it for preprocessing. The fifteen columns were renamed consistently with their aforementioned descriptions, with vhi_tf corresponding to very high interaction_treatment failure and ni corresponding to no interaction. Missing values were not detected.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
colnames(dataset) <- c("id", "sex", "bcd4", "fcd4", "brna", "frna", "bweight", "fweight", 
"therapy", "response", "vhi_tf", "hi_tf", "li", "vli", "ni")
head(dataset, n = 5)
```

The brna and frna columns were multiplied by 10^2^ to simplify the unit from times 10^2^ copies to just copies. This aligns their unit with that used for RNA load in the WHO definition of HIV (World Health Organization, n.d.).

The vhi_tf, hi_tf, li, vli, and ni columns were verified to have only one value per row. Hence, the binary system was relabeled as vhi_tf to ni using the case_when function and merged under a newly defined dreaction column. This brought down the number of columns to eleven.

```{r}
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tdataset <- dataset |>
  mutate(brna = brna*10^2) |>
  mutate(frna = frna*10^2) |> # simplifies the unit from times 10^2 copies to just copies
  mutate(dreaction = case_when(vhi_tf == 1 ~ "vhi_tf",
                              hi_tf == 1 ~ "hi_tf",
                              li == 1 ~ "li",
                              vli == 1 ~ "vli",
                              ni == 1 ~ "ni")) |> # relabels drug reactions as 
  # vhi_tf to ni and merges them under a newly defined dreaction column
  select(-vhi_tf, -hi_tf, -li, -vli, -ni)
head(tdataset, n = 5)
```


### _Preprocessed Dataset_


The sex, therapy, and dreaction variables of the dataset were changed from character to numeric class using the factor and as.numeric functions to allow for numerical data examination. All eleven variables showed good data variability.

The correlation coefficients across variables were calculated and visualized using the cor and corrplot functions (fig. 2; Wei and Simko 2021).

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
tdataset1 <- tdataset |>
  mutate(sex = as.numeric(factor(sex))) |>
  mutate(therapy = as.numeric(factor(therapy))) |>
  mutate(dreaction = as.numeric(factor(dreaction, c("ni", "vli", "li", "hi_tf", "vhi_tf"))))
```

```{r fig2, fig.cap = "Matrix of the correlation coefficients between variables."}
if(!require(corrplot)) install.packages("corrplot", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor(tdataset1), method = "square", diag = FALSE, addCoef.col = "gray", tl.col = "black", number.cex = 0.5, number.digits = 2) # shows the correlation coefficients with 2 decimal digits across all variables
```

Patient response and drug reaction highly correlated with each other, having an absolute coefficient of 74% (fig. 2). This was expected as they refer to similar information. Hence, only the dreaction variable was retained as an outcome for the purpose of this project.

On the other hand, CD4 count was negatively correlated with drug reaction (-48% and -54%) whereas RNA load was positively correlated with it (41% and 55%), while having minimal correlation with each other (fig. 2). This indicated that the bcd4, fcd4, brna, and frna variables contained distinct information relevant to drug reaction, and were kept as predictors.

The preprocessed dataset was streamlined to contain only these pertinent predictors and outcome for faster classification modeling. The dreaction variable was changed from character to factor class as required for outcomes in classification models.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pdataset <- tdataset |>
  select(bcd4, fcd4, brna, frna, dreaction) |> # keeps CD4 count and RNA load as 
  # predictors and drug reaction as outcome
  mutate(dreaction = factor(dreaction, c("ni", "vli", "li", "hi_tf", "vhi_tf")))
head(pdataset, n = 5)
```


## Predictors and Outcome


The predictors CD4 count and RNA load are measures of immune system health and HIV status, respectively (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 10; World Health Organization, n.d.). They are crucial markers of drug reaction and treatment failure that can be obtained from simple laboratory tests in settings with limited resources for the costly viral genotyping to determine drug resistance (Isaakidis et al. 2010, 7; Kitchen et al. 2001, 471; Revell et al. 2010, 605).

The interactions of these predictors with drug reaction were further visualized using ggplot2 functions (fig. 3). The plots showed a general increase in CD4 count and decrease in RNA load at follow-up. This indicated the robustness of the immune system of most patients in suppressing the HIV and positive patient response to the treatment (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 10).

However, the plots also exhibited patients who retained a low CD4 count and high RNA load at follow-up (fig. 3). They were the same cases classified as with high drug interaction and treatment failure.

```{r fig3, out.width = "45%", fig.cap = "Scatterplots of CD4 count, RNA load, and the corresponding drug reaction at baseline and follow-up.", fig.show = "hold"}
pdataset |>
  ggplot(aes(brna, bcd4, color = dreaction)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "black", size = 0.5, method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # adds a trend line
  scale_x_continuous("Baseline RNA Load", limits = c(100, 700)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Baseline CD4 Count", limits = c(0, 2000)) + # encompasses the full range of the axes of baseline and follow-up data for ease of comparison
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Drug Reaction", type = c("dodgerblue4", "green4", "yellow2", "orange3", "tomato4"))
pdataset |>
  ggplot(aes(frna, fcd4, color = dreaction)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "black", size = 0.5, method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous("Follow-up RNA Load", limits = c(100, 700)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Follow-up CD4 Count", limits = c(0, 2000)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Drug Reaction", type = c("dodgerblue4", "green4", "yellow2", "orange3", "tomato4"))
```


## Classification Models


In the final dataset with the bcd4, fcd4, brna, and frna variables as predictors, and the dreaction variable as outcome, there were only 1,056 observations. The dataset was split into 80% train set and 20% test set using the createDataPartition function to maximize the data available for both training and testing. The function additionally preserves the distribution of the five outcome classes of the dreaction variable: ni, vli, li, hi_tf, and vhi_tf (Kuhn 2019).

```{r}
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(caret)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(20, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
# set.seed(20) # if using R 3.5 or earlier
# for reproducibility during assessment
train_index <- createDataPartition(pdataset$dreaction, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_set <- pdataset[train_index,]
test_set <- pdataset[-train_index,]
```

Classification models introduced in the program that can possibly accommodate the nonlinear nature of the decision boundaries of the outcome classes (similar to what was observed in fig. 3) were successively optimized on the train set with the train function (Haugh 2017; Irizarry 2002). We discuss them in the following subsections. The streamlined dataset allowed for the use of the default resampling method of the function that is bootstrapping for twenty-five times, which would have been time consuming otherwise. Thereafter, the models were evaluated for the accuracy of their outcome prediction in the test set. The sensitivity or true positive rate and specificity or true negative rate of their prediction were also checked to rule out the effect of prevalence (Irizarry 2002).


### _k-Nearest Neighbor Classification_


The k-Nearest Neighbor Classification determines the class of a data point based on the majority class among its neighboring data points  (Haugh 2017). The number of neighbors k can be optimized to maximize the accuracy  (Irizarry 2002). In the train set, the optimal model was tuned at 3 neighbors, with an accuracy of 80.4%.

Its predicted drug reaction and treatment failure was obtained using the predict function. This was compared with the observed drug reaction in the test set utilizing the confusionMatrix function, which resulted in an accuracy of 88%. The accuracy came with good sensitivity and specificity for most outcome classes, but the model had a low true positive detection rate for the class hi_tf.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(30, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
# set.seed(30) # if using R 3.5 or earlier
knn_model <- train(dreaction ~ ., train_set, method = "knn", 
 tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(3, 9, 1))) # tunes neighbor number
knn_model

knn_dreaction <- predict(knn_model, test_set)
head(knn_dreaction)
confusionMatrix(knn_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$overall["Accuracy"]
confusionMatrix(knn_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$byClass[, 1:2]
```


### _Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees Model_


The Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees model forms successive dichotomous data splitting to derive the class of a data point, such that it looks like an inverted tree (ScienceDirect 2007). The complexity parameter at which the tree will be pruned in the case of an unimportant data splitting can be tuned (Therneau, Atkinson, and Ripley 2022). This model was optimized on the train set at a complexity parameter of 0 and an accuracy of 96.1%.

The test accuracy of its outcome prediction was at 97.6%, higher than that from the preceding model and with high sensitivity and specificity for all outcome classes.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(40, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
# set.seed(40) # if using R 3.5 or earlier
rpart_model <- train(dreaction ~ ., train_set, method = "rpart", 
 tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0, 0.1, 0.01))) # tunes tree complexity
rpart_model

rpart_dreaction <- predict(rpart_model, test_set)
confusionMatrix(rpart_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$overall["Accuracy"]
confusionMatrix(rpart_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$byClass[, 1:2]
```


### _Rborist Model_


The Rborist model improves on the prediction of the Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees model using the average of multiple trees to classify a data point (Irizarry 2002). Its accuracy can be optimized through the number of predictors for data splitting and the size of its terminal node (The Comprehensive R Archive Network n.d.). In the train set, the optimal model was tuned at 4 predictors and terminal node size of 1, with an accuracy of 97.7%.

Its predicted drug reaction had a test accuracy of 99%, higher than those from the first two models. The accuracy was supported by excellent sensitivity and specificity for all outcome classes.

```{r}
if(!require(Rborist)) install.packages("Rborist", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(Rborist)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(50, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
# set.seed(50) # if using R 3.5 or earlier
rborist_model <- train(dreaction ~ ., train_set, method = "Rborist", 
 tuneGrid = expand.grid(predFixed = seq(1, 4), minNode = seq(1, 4))) # tunes combinations 
  # of predictor number and terminal node size
rborist_model

rborist_dreaction <- predict(rborist_model, test_set)
confusionMatrix(rborist_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$overall["Accuracy"]
confusionMatrix(rborist_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$byClass[, 1:2]
```


### _Quadratic Discriminant Analysis_


The Quadratic Discriminant Analysis classifies data points with flexible decision boundaries derived from quadratic functions (Haugh 2017). Unlike the previous models, this does not have a parameter for tuning to maximize its accuracy. Accordingly, this model had the lowest training accuracy of 72.7%.

The test accuracy of its outcome prediction was at 76.1%, lower than those from the preceding models. The accuracy was accompanied by good specificity, but the model had mediocre to poor true positive detection rates for the classes vli, li, and hi_tf.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(60, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.6 or later
# set.seed(60) # if using R 3.5 or earlier
qda_model <- train(dreaction ~ ., train_set, method = "qda")
qda_model

qda_dreaction <- predict(qda_model, test_set)
confusionMatrix(qda_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$overall["Accuracy"]
confusionMatrix(qda_dreaction, test_set$dreaction)$byClass[, 1:2]
```


## Multi-class Classification Model


The Rborist model proved to be the superior classification model in this project. It predicted drug reaction and treatment failure from baseline and follow-up CD4 count and RNA load using 4 predictors for data splitting and a terminal node size of 1: $Rborist(x, y, predFixed = 4, minNode = 1)$. Its test accuracy of 99% was backed by excellent sensitivity and specificity in detecting the five outcome classes. Additionally, this accuracy came from a lower training accuracy of 97.7%, signifying that the model was not overtrained.

The Rborist model averages multiple trees like the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm it is based on (The Comprehensive R Archive Network n.d.). Unlike in the case of the simpler Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees model, its "forest of trees" cannot be readily visualized and interpreted (Irizarry 2002). However, the varImp and ggplot2 functions were able to give an insight that the most important predictor utilized by the model was the baseline RNA load (fig. 4). The significance of baseline RNA load in predicting response to antiretroviral therapy has been observed in a previous study by Revell et al. (2010, 606) as well.

```{r fig4, fig.cap = "Bar chart of the variable importance of the Rborist model."}
ggplot(varImp(rborist_model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue4") +
  scale_x_discrete("Predictor")
```

The erroneous outcome predictions of the Rborist model were tabulated with those of the other models and the test set to additionally examine the possibility of enhancing the Rborist model by ensembling. However, this did not appear to be the solution, not even if we resolve possible ties by weeding out the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis prediction, which had the lowest test accuracy.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
which_index <- c(which(rborist_dreaction != test_set$dreaction))
# [1] 15 61
tibble(rborist = rborist_dreaction[which_index], rpart = rpart_dreaction[which_index], 
 knn = knn_dreaction[which_index], qda = qda_dreaction[which_index], 
 test_set = test_set$dreaction[which_index])
```


## Conclusion


In this project, a multi-class Rborist classification model that predicted antiretroviral therapy reaction and failure from baseline and follow-up CD4 count and RNA load with an accuracy of 99% was developed on the Unique Records of the Akwa Ibom HIV Database. This machine-learning model allows for the early and cost-effective identification of patients who are in need of an immediate change in therapy, which is especially valuable in settings with limited resources for the costly HIV genotyping to determine drug resistance (Ekpenyong, Etebong, and Jackson 2019, 2; Isaakidis et al. 2010; Kitchen et al. 2001, 467).
